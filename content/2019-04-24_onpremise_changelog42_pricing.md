Summary: ![Larix Cajanderi]({filename}/images/2018-11-30_changelog400/Larix_gmelinii.jpg) We are well into 2019 already and we thought we should share with you some cool announcements. Instead of posting them separately, we've managed to squeezed them into one single post and save you some precious time. Even more, here's the TL;DR just in case you don't have time right now.

We are launching Taiga On Premise as a flexible "no strings attached" private Taiga deployment for organisations that say no to SaaS but need proper support. Also, we released 4.1 and 4.2 with some very nice features and we prepare ourselves to say goodbye to the old pricing model (pre-March 2018) in May and setup a transition plan for the remaining accounts.

## Taiga On Premise

Who would've thought this, right? Isn't "behind you firewall" deployments a thing of the past? No, they aren't and our data shows it's actually trending now. The reason? The Cloud/SaaS model has proven a bit too much unreliable for many organisations that haven't seen the likes of Cambridge Analytica and other data thefts in 2018 particularly encouraging. Taiga is not THAT big (yet) to counteract official organisation policies and we need to adapt to what our clients have been asking us for many months now; A fully supported Taiga deployment that runs on YOUR infrastructure.

It comes in several flavours depending on your needs. From the "all-in-one" server for up to 100 users to a high availability behemoth for more than 2000 users. We even have a nice form to let you know specify your needs (as a conversation starter). Head to https://taiga.io/pricing and select "Self-managed" tab. We should be able to match your infrastructure ecosystem easily.

If you're interested in moving from taiga.io into your own Taiga server, that's fine and we can help migrate your projects from one platform to the other. It's not something we are planning to encourage or expect from taiga.io users but it's definitely an option. Taiga will still be downloadable for free as it's Open Source but please don't expect similar levels of support for the thousands of Taiga instances that run independently.

Oh! And we're excited to have none other than the Fedora Project (RedHat sponsored community of developers and software) be one of the first paying customers for Taiga On Premise and that's a BIG and demanding community.

So, if you think you would like to know more about Taiga On Premise, just contact us via the form here https://taiga.io/pricing.

## Taiga 4.1 and 4.2

We have been busy improving Taiga as well! Let us highlight the most interesting new stuff you have probably already noticed in our recent minor releases.

### Negative filters

IMAGEN

We had awesome filters for virtually everything in Taiga but we now have an advanced mode where you can specify whether a filter choice is meant to be positive or negative. If you really want to make sure something does not appear, select the negative filter for that. Of course, you can combine any number of positive and negative filters to suit your needs!

### Promote Task to User Story

IMAGEN

We had the infamous "It's not a bug, it's a feature" use case covered almost from the very begiining of Taiga as a product but some of you really lobbied hard for applying the same "upgrade" mode for tasks. And it's true, sometimes a task belonging to a user story becomes so big that it deserves to be its own user story. Now you can easily do this and still keep track of where that user story actually came from.

### Display User Story in Sprint Taskboard

IMAGEN

Also, something people asked for recently regarding SCRUM and saving you even more clicks was the possibility to show user story status directly on Sprint Taskboard. It might seem trivial but we always make sure every bit of info shown doesn't come with unneeded visual pain.

### Epic dashboard "closed" filter

IMAGEN

Epic module allows you to easily keep track of multiple user stories' progress whether they belong to one or multiple projects. Overtime, the list of closed child user stories might become too cumbersome or even the number of closed Epic user stories so we added two nice little filters to let you get rid of them.

### Hebrew and Basque languages added

IMAGEN

Did you know that Taiga has been translated to more than 20 languages thanks to our amazing community? It's one of the things about Taiga we're most proud of. We believe you should be able to use software in the language you choose, whether it's the modern lingua franca that English has become or any other choice. We would like to welcome Basque/Euskara and Hebrew/עברית (with RTL support, of course) to our growing family of supported languages!

## Say goodbye to old pricing in May 2019

When we launched Taiga pricing model we were not really sure what would work for all parties. It had to make sense for different sized organisations and uses and also make sure we can be a sustainable business based on 100% open source development. More than one year ago we announced that we would switch to a "number of projects" model to a "number of seats" model but that we would give one entire year for existing accounts to make the transition.

The new model is much simpler and fairer. You just pay for the number of users belonging to all your owned projects (one user account counts only once no matter how many project they belong to). You get unlimited private projects and we got rid of a complex tier system. If you are a small team, chances are that you will pay less with the new model. If you are a big team, the opposite might be true as well, but still well within competitive margins compared to other platforms out there.

Anyway, we will shortly start asking the few of you remaining on the old plan to migrate to the new one. 30th of July will be the hard limit for those assisted migrations. The sooner you are willing to migrate, the greater the discount. If by the 31st of July you are still on the old pricing, we will send a final notice and issue the migration automatically so if you're fine with it, you can ignore all of this since we will be taking care of the process for you anyway.

For those that really want to benefit from big discounts (up to 50% for a complete year), be sure to contact us before the the 31st of May with an approximate number of users and the existing Taiga billed account.

## What's next?

We have many plans for 2019. First, we expect Taiga On Premise to be something BIG! We are also planning on a 5.0 release that will feature a complete overhaul on detail view for user stories/tasks/issue as well as a brand new dashboard focused on helping you decide what to do next when you have conflicting priorities as well as being able to see your colleagues' dashboards (where permissions allow for).

We want to continue our work on performance, particularly on KANBAN and give KANBAN a bunch of new features this year. Also, we plan to merge some project sections that make more sense if they're together. TaigaApp deal is also almost implemented into taiga.io now so you will be able to use TaigaApp for free if you're a paying customer.

Let's not forget about Taiga Seedtime! Sorry for the radio silence on this one. We got enough feedback from selected teams on this "fun and productive agile estimation tool" and we are almost ready to let you play with it very soon!

Finally, we are planning to host our first Taiga Conference this year! We still need to nail down the details but if we find time this Autumn for such an event, you'll be the first to know :)

Thanks for reading all the way through the text-wall!
