Summary: ![Pulsatilla Patens]({filename}/images/2016-04-04_changelog200/pulsatilla_patens.jpg) We are well into 2019 already, and thought we'd should some cool announcements. Instead of posting them separately, we're squeezing them into a single post to save you some precious time. Even more, here's the TL;DR just in case you don't have time right now.

**TL;DR**

We are launching Taiga On Premise as a flexible "no strings attached" private Taiga deployment for organisations who are saying no-no to SaaS, but still need proper support. Also, we released 4.1 and 4.2 with some very nice features. In May we're also saying goodbye to our old pricing model (which pre-March 2018 users) and setting up a transition plan for the remaining accounts.

## Taiga On Premise

Who would've thought it, right? That "behind you firewall" deployments would make a comeback thing? Well, be it for privacy or corporate security reasons, our data shows users are increasingly asking for managed instances behind their own firewall. Perhaps the Cloud/SaaS model has proven a bit too much unreliable for some organisations, perhaps events like data thefts by the likes of Cambridge Analytica are causing concern.

At Taiga we're happy to oblige and adapt to what our clients need; An option for fully supported Taiga deployment that runs on YOUR OWN infrastructure.

Our service comes in several flavours depending on your needs. From the "all-in-one" server for up to 100 users to a high availability behemoth for more than 2000 users. If this is up your alley,  start the conversation and let us know specific needs by heading to [https://taiga.io/pricing](https://taiga.io/pricing) and select "Self-managed" tab. We should be able to match your infrastructure ecosystem easily.

If you're interested in moving from taiga.io to your own Taiga server, that's fine and we can help migrate your projects from one platform to the other. It's not something we plan to encourage or expect from taiga.io users but it's definitely an option. Taiga will still be downloadable for free as it's Open Source but please don't expect similar levels of support for the thousands of Taiga instances that run independently.

Oh! And we're excited to have none other than the Fedora Project (RedHat sponsored community of developers and software) as one of the first On Premise customers. That's a BIG and demanding community. If we can do it for them, we can do it for you!

So, if you'd like to know more about Taiga On Premise, just contact us via the form here [https://taiga.io/pricing](https://taiga.io/pricing).

## Taiga 4.1 and 4.2

We've been busy improving Taiga as well! Here's the most interesting new stuff from our most recent minor releases:

### Negative filters

![Negative filters]({filename}/images/2019-04-25_onpremise42pricing/negative-filters.gif)

We had awesome filters for virtually everything in Taiga, but now have an advanced mode where you can specify whether a filter choice is meant to be positive or negative. If you really want to make sure something does not appear, select the negative filter for that. Of course, you can combine any number of positive and negative filters to suit your needs!

### Promote Task to User Story

![Promote Task to User Story]({filename}/images/2019-04-25_onpremise42pricing/promote-task-to-us.gif)

We had the infamous "It's not a bug, it's a feature" use case covered almost from the outset of Taiga, but some of you lobbied really hard for applying the same "upgrade" mode for tasks. And it's true, sometimes a task belonging to a user story becomes so big that it deserves to be its own user story. Now you can easily do this and still keep track of where that user story actually came from.

### Display User Story in Sprint Taskboard

![Display User Story in Sprint Taskboard]({filename}/images/2019-04-25_onpremise42pricing/display-us-status-taskboard.gif)

Also, regarding SCRUM, recently people have asked for ways to save you even more clicks, as you navigate to show user story status directly on Sprint Taskboard. It might seem trivial but we always make sure every bit of info shown doesn't come with unneeded visual pain.

### Epic dashboard "closed" filter

![Epic dashboard "closed" filter]({filename}/images/2019-04-25_onpremise42pricing/epics-filter.gif)

Epic module allows you to easily keep track of multiple user stories' progress whether they belong to one or multiple projects. Overtime, the list of closed child user stories might become too cumbersome or even the number of closed Epic user stories so we added two nice little filters to let you get rid of them.

### Hebrew and Basque languages added

![Hebrew and Basque languages added]({filename}/images/2019-04-25_onpremise42pricing/hebrew-rtl-language.gif)

Did you know that Taiga has been translated to more than 20 languages thanks to our amazing community? It's one of the things about Taiga we're most proud of. We believe you should be able to use software in the language you choose, whether it's the modern lingua franca that English has become or any other choice. We would like to welcome Basque/Euskara and Hebrew/עברית (with RTL support, of course) to our growing family of supported languages!

## Say goodbye to old pricing in June 2019

When we launched Taiga's first pricing model we weren't sure it would work for all parties. It had to make sense for different sized organisations and users, and it also had to allow us to build a sustainable business based on 100% open source development. More than a year ago we announced that we would switch from a "number of projects" model to a "number of seats" model but that we would give one entire year for existing accounts to make the transition.

The new model is much simpler and fairer. You just pay for the number of users belonging to all your owned projects (one user account counts only once no matter how many project they belong to). You get unlimited private projects and we got rid of a complex tier system. If you're a small team, chances are that you'll pay less with the new model. If you're a big team, the opposite might be true as well, but still, well within competitive margins compared by other platforms out there.

Anyway, we will shortly be asking the few of you remaining on the old plan to migrate to a new plan. We hope you'll stay with us! You can learn how the current pricing model works here: [https://taiga.io/pricing](https://taiga.io/pricing)

The date by which all plan migrations will have to be made is July 30. The sooner you migrate, the greater the discount. If by the 30th of July you're still on the old pricing, we will send a final notice and issue the migration automatically. If you're fine with the pricing change, you're free to ignore our notices. Your invoices and charges will be made as always.

If you're unhappy with the change and have concerns with the pricing, please reach out. We're not offering special plans, but we do want to work with you to ensure a smooth transition.

For those of you want to benefit from big discounts (up to 50% for a complete year), be sure to contact us before the the 31st of May with an approximate number of users and the existing Taiga billed account.

## What's next?

We have more good stuff coming in 2019. First, we expect Taiga On Premise to be something BIG! We are also planning on a 5.0 release that will feature a complete overhaul of the detail view for user stories/tasks/issue as well as a brand new dashboard focused on helping you decide what to do next when you have conflicting priorities as well as being able to see your colleagues' dashboards (where permissions allow for).

We want to continue our work on performance, particularly on KANBAN and give KANBAN a bunch of new features this year. Also, we plan to merge some project sections that make more sense if they're together. TaigaApp deal is also almost implemented into taiga.io now so you will be able to use TaigaApp for free if you're a paying customer.

![Seedtime]({filename}/images/2019-04-25_onpremise42pricing/seedtime.jpg)

Let's not forget about Taiga Seedtime! Sorry for the radio silence on this one. We got enough feedback from selected teams on this "fun and productive agile estimation tool" and we are almost ready to let you play with it very soon!

Finally, we are planning to host our first Taiga Conference this year! We still need to nail down the details but if we find time this Autumn for such an event, you'll be the first to know :)

Thanks for reading all the way through the text-wall!
